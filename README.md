# About
This repository is my take on learning OpenGL, following (www.learnopengl.com)[www.learnopengl.com].
I've also used the opengl boilerplate created by (RainEggplant)[https://github.com/RainEggplant/opengl-mingw-boilerplate] to be able to build this project with mingw to not be dependant on visual studio and be multi-platform.
