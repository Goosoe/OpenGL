# About
This repository is my take on learning OpenGL, following the www.learnopengl.com tutorial.
I've also used the opengl boilerplate found in https://github.com/RainEggplant/opengl-mingw-boilerplate to be able to build this project with mingw to not be dependant on visual studio and be multi-platform.
